## Dataset Overview and Source ðŸ“ˆ

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new). It includes information about video details, such as video ID, trending date, title, channel, category, views, likes, dislikes, comment count, and more.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning ðŸ§¹

The following steps were taken to prepare and clean the dataset for analysis:

- Unnecessary columns were dropped.
- Categories were obtained from the JSON dataset.
- Data was merged with category information.
- Rows with 0 likes and 0 dislikes were removed.
- Dates were formatted and transformed as needed.
- Data was normalized using Min-Max scaling.
- A sample subset of the data was created for further analysis.
